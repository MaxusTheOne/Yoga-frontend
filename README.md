# YogaFrontend

-   **Hosted:** [https://marcelayoga.netlify.app/](https://marcelayoga.netlify.app/)

## Running Locally

If you want to run it on your local backend (ignore this step to use our Azure hosted site), follow these steps:

1. Change the `VITE_BACKEND_ENDPOINT` in the `.env` file to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

    or whatever you have set as your localhost.

2. Save the changes.

3. Navigate to the `YogaFrontend` directory in your terminal.

4. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now, your frontend should be running locally. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the local version.
