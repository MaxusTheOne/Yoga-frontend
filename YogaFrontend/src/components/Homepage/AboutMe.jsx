                    I am passionate about helping others transform their lives
                    by teaching them to live in health, strength, joy, and
                    balance. I have been practicing and studying
                    transformational techniques including yoga, meditation,
                    stress release and breathing techniques for nearly 18 years.
                    Originally from Mexico, and have lived in France, UK,
                    Switzerland, Denmark, and USA where I learned from the very
                    best teachers I have met on my path. At the age of 24, while
                    in a whole new country and looking for new ways to meet
                    people and exercise, I tried yoga for the first Ame. Little
                    did I know that at that very moment, my life would change
                    for the better. I remember feeling at home – within my own
                    skin – it felt intuitively right. It was not long after that
                    first class, that I noticed how I’d gotten better at
                    handling the challenges of my new life, how I was feeling
                    better physically, and emotionally. I was hooked! I am
                    dedicated to teaching from a place that creates connection
                    between our noisy, at times stressful, lives and the inner
                    wisdom of the mind, body & breath.
